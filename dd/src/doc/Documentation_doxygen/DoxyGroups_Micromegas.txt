 \defgroup creep The creep mode
 \ingroup particles
 This module of mM was initially developed by B. Devincre and A. Benzerga during the latter stay at the Onera in 2012.
 They proposed to account for particles bypassing with dislocation climb using a phenomenological procedure.
 Dislocations blocked against particles are supposed to shear such obstacles during a "timebreak"
 event if the blocked dislocations have been immobilized long enough to bypass the particle with climb.
 In this phenomenological description of plastic relaxation with climb, the dislocation line stay in their glide plane.
 The present procedure does not differentiate segment blocked outside the particle and the one inside a particle.

 The model requires:
 - a climb velocity equation taken from \cite Bako:2011fk
 - a calculation of the climb force (from the P-K force calculation)
 - a list of dislocation segments blocked by particles
 - an identification of the blocked segment glide plane
 - a strain rate criteria to decide when dislocation glide is to slow and must be assisted by climb
 - a procedure to identify the first blocked segment which can bypass a particle with climb.
 - a list of glide planes containing segments free to cut particle with the climb process
 - A file monitoring all the climb event and the corresponding time increment.

 The most important variables used in the creep mode are:
 - 'creep' is the switch variable to activate climb procedure in mM
 - 'timebreak' is the switch variable put to yes when plastic strain with glide is to slow and a climb 'timebreak' event is requested
 - 'epsilonpoint' is the strain rate reference value used to switch from glide to climb mode
 - 'nstatcontrol' is the number of steps used to calculate the strain rate and the minimum delay between climb 'timebreak' events
 - 'npar_touch' is the number of dislocation glide segments touching a particles before the cutting process.
 - 'npar_cut' is the number of dislocation glide planes with segments in particle cutting process.
 - 'par_touch(:,:)' is a list to keep information on particle planes where segments are stopped.
 - 'par_cut(:,:)' is a list to keep information on particle planes where segment are in cutting process
