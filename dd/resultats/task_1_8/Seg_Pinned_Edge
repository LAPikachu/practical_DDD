This is an example of segment file iThe segment file structure :

Line 1: An integer for each slip system is first defined to ponderate the Schmid factors on slip systems
(1 means that any change is made, 0 means that the Schmid factor is artificially set to zero)

line 2: The number of segments

line 3: dimensions of the simulation reference volume

Form line 3 to doted lines: the segments description
column 1 - The segment index
column 2 - x coordinate of the segment origin
column 3 - y coordinate of the segment origin
column 4 - y coordinate of the segment origin
column 5 - length of the segment in BVD vector unit
column 6 - index of the BVD vector parallel to the segment direction
column 7 - first neighbor segment at the origin of the segment (zero for pining point)
column 8 - first non zero length neighbor segment at the origin (idem)
column 9 - first neighbor segment at the extremity side (idem)
column 10- first non zero length neighbor segment at the extremity side (idem)
column 11- Flag for junction segment
column 12- index of the binome segment use to form a junction
column 13- Flag for screw segment in cross-slip state (blocked at the intersection of different glide planes)

Please, note that the index of column 7 to 10 can be negative in starting files.
Negative index, means that segments connectivity is relative and must be completed
When needed, additional kneecaps will be added to the initial configuration.n a cubic periodic volume including an infinite edge dislocation
