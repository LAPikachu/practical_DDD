This is the directory where all the input files of the simulation mM are located!

To run a standard DD simulation, one need to define  three input files identified thanks to "input.dd"
--> the material variables file                     (e.g. Cu)
--> the control parameters file                    (e.g. ContCu)
--> the intial dislocation configuration file     (e.g. SegCu)

Few exemples of such files, corresponding to different types of materials or simulation experiments, are provided
in this mM directory.

A discription of the intial dislocation configuration file format is given at the end of "SegCu"

--------

Additionaly, The following files should be present in mM archives (or will be present after your first run).

- inputconfinit -> the input file used by the application "confinit" to generate an initial configuration

- b_plan, b_poly, b_sphere, euler_angle -> the input files needed to run polyphase simulations

- particules -> the input file needed tu run DD simulation in a matrix including small (point) elastic inclusions

- shift_rotation  -> the input file used to impose a shift and/or a rotation at the boundaries of the simulation periodic cell

- random -> a seed file used by the fibonatchy random generator 

- SEG_relax and SEG_save -> two outputs of the simulation (after the initial relaxation or later) 
                            that can be used latter as initial configuration file.

- disdi -> the file containing tabulated values of anisotropic line tension as a function of dislocation character
           (this file is generated with disdi, J. Douin's computation code).

- tensapp -> The file containing a reference applied tensor used for complex loading
