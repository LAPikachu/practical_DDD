> End of the reading for mM, info and examples are following

******ALL PLANES MUST BE DEFINED WITH THE NORMAL VECTOR (MILLER INDEX) POINTING OUTSIDE THE VOLUME**********

line 1 = the variable named longminseg gives the minimum lenght to discretize segments stopped
         on barriers (minimum lenght->modur/longminseg)
line 2 = the total number of planes defining the closed domaine of simulation (e.g. a cubic doamine =6)
         Notice that "0" means that any closed domaine is defined.
line 3 = T means that the intial dislocations must be outside the close area defined above
         F means that the intial dislocations must be inside the close area defined above
line 4 = Additional number of planes with respect to line 2 for independent internal barriers
line 5 = Additional number of free surface plane. The normal vector is pointing in the free space direction

from line 5 = each normal planes vector (e.g. 0 0 1) and the shifting amplitude D such that Ax + By + Cz = D

******* The following examples are made assuming a simulated volume of shape  3632 4016 4816
        One must take care of periodic boundary condition which is the default boundary condition in mM

example (1) a periodic bicrystal
100                  !  longminseg
0                    !  nbplanDom
F                    !  InclExcl

0                    !  NbFreePlan
1 0 0      1816      !  varplan     posplan

example (2) a periodic lattice of cubes free of dislocations in the simulated volume
In this case, any dislocation line in the initial configuration must enter the dislocation free zone
