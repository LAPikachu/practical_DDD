Input file for the simulations working with closed domains

<--> In micromegas the boundaries of a convex domain are defined using equation of planes (Ax + By + Cz = D   A,B and C must be integer)
<--> Concave domains must be defined as the union of convex domain

******ALL PLANES MUST BE DEFINED WITH THE NORMAL VECTOR (MILLER INDEX) POINTING OUTSIDE THE VOLUME**********

exemple (1)  cubic box with fixed boundaries
1                    !  NbCvxDom = number of convex domains in the simulation box

6                    !  Nbplcvxdom = number of fixed boundaries
0                    !  NbFreeSurf = number of free surfaces

-1 0 0       -100.   0  ! Equation of the first plane in the cubic box Ax + By + Cz = D. the 0 at the end means that this is a "real" boundary
0 -1 0       -100.   0
0 0 -1       -100.   0
1 0 0    3000.       0
0 1 0    3000.       0
0 0 1    3000.       0  ! Equation of the sixth plane in the cubic box Ax + By + Cz = D. the 0 at the end means that this is a "real" boundary


exemple (3) concave domain composed by four convex domains (be carefull to define a concave domain, the convex domains must be contiguous)
4                   !  NbCvxDom = number of convex domains in the simulation box

2                    !  Nbplcvxdom = number of fixed boundaries in the first convex domain
2                    !  NbFreeSurf = number of free surfaces in the first convex domain

2                    !  Nbplcvxdom = number of fixed boundaries in the second convex domain
2                    !  NbFreeSurf = number of free surfaces in the second convex domain


3                    !  Nbplcvxdom = number of fixed boundaries in the third convex domain
1                    !  NbFreeSurf = number of free surfaces in the third convex domain

3                    !  Nbplcvxdom = number of fixed boundaries in the fourth convex domain
0                    !  NbFreeSurf = number of free surfaces in the fourth convex domain


0 0 -1    -2000.     0 ! Equation of the first plane in the first convex domain  (Ax + By + Cz = D). the 0 at the end means that this is a "real" boundary for the concave domain
0 1 0  1908          1 ! Equation of the second plane in the first convex domain  (Ax + By + Cz = D). the 1 at the end means that this is NOT a "real" boundary for the concave domain, but an internal bounadary, shared with another convex domain
0 1 1 5008           0 ! Equation of the third plane in the first convex domain  (Ax + By + Cz = D). Free surface, the 0 at the end means that this is a "standalone" free surface
0 0 1     4000.      2 ! Equation of the fourth plane in the first convex domain  (Ax + By + Cz = D). Free surface. the 2 at the end means   that this free surface is shared with another convex domain
