===============================================================

This file defines the inputs to build up different kind of initial configurations (microstructure)
for the mM simulation. (to generate an initial configuration you have to launch ../bin/mm --initconf)

Four different types of configuration are now proposed in confinit:
    micro = 1
  The initial configuration is made of a random distribution of pinned segments,
acting as Frank-Read sources.
    micro = 2
  The initial configuration is made of a random distribution of pinned segments,
acting as Frank-Read sources. But now, the mechanical state of the initial
configuration is optimized by considering dipoles segments. In the simulated volume
there is always two segments with same length and opposite sign.
    micro = 3
  The initial configuration is made of a random distribution of dipolar loops.
Such loops are made of four edge segments in different glide planes. Such loops
are glissile and helps forming rapidly a 3D dislocation network free of any pinning points
    micro = 4
  The initial configuration is made of a random distribution of glissile loops. Attention
is paid to define only expending loops for a given loading condition.

Warning: for the bi-phase simulations, the initial configurations have to be build from the
output files BVD.CFC and BVD2.CFC . You should transfer BVD2.CFC as BVD.CFC in order to build
the second phase.
The volumes of the two phases must have exactly the same dimensions. As a consequence a common
"Facteur_boite" must be imposed for the two phases. After that you will probably have to rewrite
the box dimensions in order that theses dimensions would be equivalent (with the conideration of
the homothetie factor) for the two phases.
