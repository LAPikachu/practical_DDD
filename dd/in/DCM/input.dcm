Statement of the three files needed to run a microMegas simulation.
These input files must be declared in this directory "in"
They are used at the begining of the simulation
and correspond to a simple classification.

The sequence order must be respected, but the files name can be modified:
>>> The material variables file
>>> The control parameters file
>>> The intial dislocation segments configuration
>>> The control parameter file for MDC simulations

Your selection must be defined just below this line (see the Cu bench test)
