This directory is dedicated to simple scripts that can make life much more easy.
They are not at all needed, but some of us found usefull to define the "bin" and "exec" directories
in their PATH. With such a trick, you can run automatic and recurent procedures from everywhere.

Some oldies are provided as exemples (they may not work anymore).
You can easily develop yours and feel free to share then if they can be usefull to others.
