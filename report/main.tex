\section{Introduction}
The topic of this practical is to get an introduction into \textit{discrete dislocation dynamic} (DDD)  simulations. In the course of the following exercises the open-source software \textit{microMegas} (mM) is utilized \cite{devincre2011}.   

As it is common for DDD simulation, three steps are carried out to model the dynamics of the dislocations:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item calculate the stress field 
	\item calculate the Forces acting on the dislocation line segments (according to eq. \ref{eq:peach-koehler} - the Peach-Köhler equation)
	\item moving the line segments accordingly - the velocities are calculated according to eq. \ref{eq:vleocities_mobility_func} and are moved following forward Euler (eq. \ref{eq:forward_euler})
\end{enumerate}

\begin{equation}
	F = (\sigma_{ext}+\sigma_{int}) \mathbf{b}l  \label{eq:peach-koehler}
\end{equation}

The Peach-Köhler Equation (eq. \ref{eq:peach-koehler}) takes into account internal- \( \sigma_{int} \) and external stresses  \( \sigma_{ext} \) acting on dislocation segments of vector \(l\) with a burgers vector of \( \mathbf{b}\). In mM (and similar frameworks) \( \sigma_{ext}\) is imposed on the system as a parameter. 

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		v =& M(F) \label{eq:vleocities_mobility_func} \\
		r(t+\Delta t) =& r(t) + v(t)\Delta t \label{eq:forward_euler}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The velocities of the segments are a functional of the mobility function \(M(F)\) depending on the individual forces, the material and the orientation of the segment. The segments positions are calculated as a result of the the application of the forward Euler scheme - eq. \ref{eq:forward_euler}. The new position \( r(t+ \Delta t)\) after a time step of \(\Delta t\) is calculated as the position \(r(t)\) being moved according to its velocity \(v(t)\). For forward Euler being applicable we assume quasi-static deformation. 

As a result of the forces imposed on a dislocation, the dislocation might curve. In mM this is achieved by cutting the curved line into several segments. These segments are discretized as depicted in fig. \ref{fig:schematic_segments_dislocs}. The choice to include 8 slip systems in mM was made as trade-off - balancing the increasing complexity with the best representation of the curved dislocation \cite{devincre2011}.
