\section{Introduction}
The topic of this practical is to get an introduction into \textit{discrete dislocation dynamic} (DDD)  simulations. In the course of the following exercises the open-source software \textit{microMegas} (mM) is utilized \cite{devincre2011}.  

\subsection{General Aspects of Dislocation Dynamics} 

As it is common for DDD simulation, three steps are carried out to model the dynamics of the dislocations:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item calculate the stress field 
	\item calculate the Forces acting on the dislocation line segments (according to eq. \ref{eq:peach-koehler} - the Peach-Köhler equation)
	\item moving the line segments accordingly - the velocities are calculated according to eq. \ref{eq:vleocities_mobility_func} and are moved following forward Euler (eq. \ref{eq:forward_euler})
\end{enumerate}

\begin{equation}
	F = (\sigma_{ext}+\sigma_{int}) \mathbf{b}l  \label{eq:peach-koehler}
\end{equation}

The Peach-Köhler Equation (eq. \ref{eq:peach-koehler}) takes into account internal- \( \sigma_{int} \) and external stresses  \( \sigma_{ext} \) acting on dislocation segments of vector \(l\) with a burgers vector of \( \mathbf{b}\). In mM (and similar frameworks) \( \sigma_{ext}\) is imposed on the system as a parameter. 

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		v =& M(F) \label{eq:vleocities_mobility_func} \\
		r(t+\Delta t) =& r(t) + v(t)\Delta t \label{eq:forward_euler}
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The velocities of the segments are a functional of the mobility function \(M(F)\) depending on the individual forces, the material and the orientation of the segment. The segments positions are calculated as a result of the the application of the forward Euler scheme - eq. \ref{eq:forward_euler}. The new position \( r(t+ \Delta t)\) after a time step of \(\Delta t\) is calculated as the position \(r(t)\) being moved according to its velocity \(v(t)\). For forward Euler being applicable we assume quasi-static deformation. 

As a result of the forces imposed on a dislocation, the dislocation might curve. In mM this is achieved by cutting the curved line into several segments. These segments are discretized as depicted in fig. \ref{fig:schematic_segments_dislocs}. The choice to include 8 slip systems in mM was made as trade-off - balancing the increasing complexity with the best representation of the curved dislocation \cite{devincre2011}.

\subsection{Frank-Read Source}

The Frank-Read source is going to be in the main focus of these exercises. A Frank-Read source is a dislocation segment that is pinned at two points. The force acting on it is generally the Peach-Köhler equation (eq.~\ref{eq:peach-koehler}), where the resolved shear stress \(\tau\) is acting on the segment:
\begin{equation}
	F =  \cdot \tau \mathbf{b}l
\end{equation} 

Above a certain critical shear stress \(\tau_{crit}\) the dislocation segment is becoming an infinite source for dislocation loops (see fig. \ref{fig:frank-read-scheme}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{schematics_frank_read.png}
	\caption{ Activation of a Frank-Read source: Dislocation segment (a) is pinned at point A
		and B. Under the applied shear stress τ it starts to bow out (b) till it reaches
		its critical configuration (c), and then expands through its unstable state (d) till
		self-anihilates to a dislocation loop and a new FR segment (e) reproduced from \cite{zaiser}.}
	\label{fig:frank-read-scheme}
\end{figure}

The bow out stress given by Hirth ( \cite{anderson2017}, P. 752):

\begin{equation}
	b\tau_{crit} = \frac{\mu b^{2}}{4\pi r(1-\nu)} \biggl\{ \biggl[\ 1- \frac{\nu}{2}(3-4\cos^{2}\beta) \biggr]\ \ln \frac{L}{\rho} -1 + \frac{\nu}{2} \biggr\}
\end{equation}

for the common case of \( L =1000\rho \) is simplified to: 

\begin{equation}
	\tau_{crit} = \alpha \frac{\mu b}{L}
\end{equation}

with \(\alpha\) being 0.5 for pure edge dislocations and 1.5 for pure screw dislocations \cite{zaiser}. 

\section{Simulation Setup (Task 1)}
The first Task deals with setting up a simulation of a pinned edge dislocation in mM. It acts as both an introduction the the software and an initial state for the following tasks.

\subsection{Installing and Getting to Know The Software (Task 1.1 - 1.3)}
In the first Task the required software is installed from the \href{http://zig.onera.fr/mm_home_page/}{microMegas Homepage}.
